# SQL-Project-AtliQ_ad-hoc_insights-
ðŸŒŸBusiness Scenario: The top executives of AtliQ Hardware (an imaginary hardware manufacturing company from India) want some quick insights to make data-informed decisions. We have 10 ad-hoc requests which we need to execute.

ðŸŒŸ Database:
We have a SQL database named 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database with ~1 million sales records. It includes six tables:
1. dim_customer: contains customer-related data
2. dim_product: contains product-related data
3. fact_gross_price: contains gross price information for each product
4. fact_manufacturing_cost: contains the cost incurred in the production of each product
5. fact_pre_invoice_deductions: contains pre-invoice deductions information for each product
6. fact_sales_monthly: contains monthly sales data for each product. 

For further info about each table, check the MetaData.txt file

Database schema:
